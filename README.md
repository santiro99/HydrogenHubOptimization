Hydrogen Hub Optimization for Master's Degree in Energy and Sustainability. 

This study presents a comprehensive optimization framework for the long-term planning and short-term operation of a hydrogen production hub under varying technological, economic, and environmental constraints in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. The model integrates both renewable-based (PEM, Alkaline) and fossil-based (SMR, CCUS) hydrogen production pathways, incorporating dynamic CAPEX, OPEX, land-use, and energy availability. By combining annual capacity expansion with weekly operational simulation, the framework estimates Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH) evolution across 2025–2050, supporting policy and investment decisions. The results show that green hydrogen via PEM electrolysis achieves competitive costs near 1.47 USD/kgH$_2$ when supported by Colombia’s low-emission grid, while fossil-based SMR exhibits significant LCOH volatility, ranging from 1.89 to over 13.8 USD/kgH$_2$ depending on policy constraints. Only the carbon pricing scenario yields hydrogen emissions below 1 kgCO$_2$/kgH$_2$, meeting global low-carbon standards. Storage deployment rises steadily across scenarios, but utilization varies widely due to overdimensioning and planning assumptions. These outcomes highlight the importance of public policy, grid integration, understanding of trade-offs between cost, emissions, infrastructure deployment and demand evolution in shaping cost-effective, low-carbon hydrogen hubs, establishing a replicable methodology for hydrogen hub design under uncertainty.

Furthermore, the model for planning and operating the hydrogen hub in Cartagena was built in Python, using the Pyomo library (Version 6.6.2) to structure the optimization logic. Pyomo was a practical choice because of its readable syntax and ability to handle both linear and nonlinear problems. To solve the model, the open-source GLPK solver (Version 0.4.8) was used, which worked well for the model's scale and allowed for easy integration with Python.
